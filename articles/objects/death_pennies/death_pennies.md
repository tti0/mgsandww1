Death pennies are large copper coins that a family member would receive when one of their kin dies in battle.

We have a picture of one that commemorates private Henry Rayner Claye, an MGS old boy. If you wish to inspect the coin it is contained in the MGS Archives.

The Death coin was a large coin, about the size of a round small dessert plate. They were often very heavy and the name of the person who died during WW1 was inscribed on the right hand side of the coin. Around the rim of the coin it says *He died for freedom and honour*. It also has two dolphins around the the rim. In the centre of the coin, there is an figure of Britannia, with her lion. Britannia, standing triumphant above a bloodied German eagle, is holding a trident in her right hand, and in its left hand there is a laurel wreath.

Along with the coin, families also received a letter from the King, which read: *I join with my grateful people in sending you this memorial of a brave life given for others in the Great War.*
