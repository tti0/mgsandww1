Teachers from MGS left to fight in various parts of the world, and for different sides. Below are the names of teachers who gave their lives for their countries.

#### Bernhard Neuendorff

Dr Bernhard Neuendorff came to the school in 1905, and took the Module 6 class for a year. He was the author of two books: *The English People's Stage in the Age of Shakespeare*, and *The Genesis of Goldsmith's Duke of Wakefield*. These books may still be purchased today. Dr Neuendorff had great admiration for English literature and customs, thus he refused to go to the Western front to fight the British, and went to the Eastern front. Dr Neuendorff fought for Germany and was killed on September 15th, 1915 at Korole, while fighting the Russians. He once rescued an Old Mancunian from drowning at camp. Even though he fought for the other side, the Ulula of 1916 commemorates the conscientiousness and gentleness of his character, his gifts as a teacher, and the fineness and sensitiveness of his nature.

#### Rene Claude Albert Boisselot

Rene Claude Albert Boisselot was a student teacher at the School in 1913-14. He had diplomas in Philosophy, Modern Languages and Law. He was very popular with all the boys, and ran many sports clubs while at the school. In many of the boy's diaries they write of Rene with happiness. The details of his death are unknown.

#### Charles Walter Merryweather

Charles Merryweather is commemorated on a memorial tablet at the school, along with his colleague, Lieutenant C.E. Fry. Merryweather was a Major in the 10th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. He was killed in action in France, on 23rd November 1916. He came to the school in 1905 after taking honours in Modern Languages at Trinity College. He was involved in many branches of school work, and he organised Sports Day every year. Early in 1915 Charles spent many weeks in Whitworth Street Hospital. After this he was hit in the stomach with a grenade and was killed instantaneously, while endeavouring to recover prisoners.

#### Charles Edward Fry

Charles Edward Fry was a Lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery, he was wounded and killed in France, April 17th, 1917, whilst unloading ammunition. He joined the staff of MGS on the Classical Side, in 1906. As he was fond of outdoor sports, he instituted the rowing club at school, and conducted the Grasmere camp for five years. Fry then returned to school after he received his commission. Then he was sent back to the RFA. When he was sent back, he showed such steadiness under fire, that he was recommended for a distinction, for which he didn't live to receive. The memorial tablet to him and Major Merryweather (see above) was unveiled on July 20th, 1920.
