# The Memorial Hall

This is the main memorial of the school.

Firstly, there is a statue with a Latin inscription underneath which translates as: *THE MEMORIES OF OUR FRIENDS KILLED IN BATTLE, 1914 to 1918*.

Also below that statue are the words: *THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE*.

Finally we have the boards: these boards have the name of every Old Mancunian who died in WW1 (and WW2).
