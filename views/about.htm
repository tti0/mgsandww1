<h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About</h3>

<p>A website with searchable details of Old Mancunians who died in the First World War, and details of the school's links to the war more generally.</p>
<p>This website is based on a project undertaken by the Manchester Grammar School History and Archives Departments in 2015, which gathered this data into a Google Site. This functioned well, but lacked meaningful search capability, added along proper database structuring (JSON) in this iteration of the site, overseen by the Computer Science Department.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<!-- TODO: Replace Homer with some more meaningful text -->
<p>Tell me, oh Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.</p>
